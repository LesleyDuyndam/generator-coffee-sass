## Usage

### Compiling
You could run 'grunt' in the terminal to compile & uglify the CoffeeScript files manually.

```
grunt
```

If you would like to compile & uglify coffeeScript automatically on file change, activate the grunt watcher. This is easily done by running the 'grunt watch' command in the terminal.

```
grunt watch
```
